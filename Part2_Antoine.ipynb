    "# Prelude: Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we have to get a little head start on the _Natural Language Processing_ part of the class. This is a new direction for us. Up to now, we've mostly been doing math-y stuff with Python, but today, we're going to be using Python to work through a text. The central thing we need to be able to do today, is to extract internal wikipedia links (links between wiki-pages). And for that we need regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The recipe below is what I told the class to do before LLMs. If you want to try to learn about regular expressions on your own, that's what you need to do. <b>BUT!</b> You don't have to. <b>For this part, it's OK to use an LLM to help you as much as you possibly can.</b> The reason I'm saying this is that I don't think having an intimate knowledge of regular expressions is important for the content of this class.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "That said, <b>using an LLM means that you have to do extra checking and testing</b>. Make sure that the code you get from your LLM actually does what you asked it to do by going through some examples and manually checking (use a real wiki page or the test-text below). If your LLM hallucinated the wrong answer and you still use the data that comes out, it will count negatively in our evaluations.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Reading/Video*\n",
    "> * Read [**this tutorial**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) to form an overview of regular expressions. This is important to understand the content of the tutorial (also very useful later), so you may actually want to work through the examples. \n",
    "> * (**Experiment**: An alternative to reading. If you love videos more than reading, you can also check out [this YouTube explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk) instead of going through the tutorial above -- it's a friendly looking young man called Kyle who goes through RegExps from his bedroom. I haven't watched the whole thing ... since I personally don't like video explainers ... but it has many views + thumbs up.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Exercises_: Regular expressions round 1\\.\n",
    "> * Now, explain in your own words: what are regular expressions?\n",
    "> * Provide an example of a regex to match 4 digits numbers (by this, I mean precisely 4 digits, you should not match any part of numbers with e.g. 5 digits). In your notebook, use `findall` to show that your regex works on this [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2020/master/files/regex_exercise.txt). **Hint**: a great place to test out regular expressions is: https://regex101.com.\n",
    "> * Provide an example of a regex to match words starting with \"super\". Show that it works on the [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2020/master/files/regex_exercise.txt).\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can go on to figure out how how to match internal wiki links. Wiki links come in two flavors. They're always enclosed in double square brackets, e.g. `[[wiki-link]]` and can either occur like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... some text [[Aristotle]] some more text ...\n",
    "\n",
    "which links to the page [`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second flavor has two parts, so that links can handle spaces and other more fancy forms of references, here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... some text [[John_McCain|John McCain]] some more text ...\n",
    "\n",
    "which links to the page [`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain). Now it's your turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Exercise_: Regular expressions round 2\\. Show that you can extract the wiki-links from the [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2022/master/files/regex_exercise.txt). Perhaps you can find inspiration on stack overflow or similar. **Hint**: Try to solve this exercise on your own (that's what you will get the most out of - learning wise), but if you get stuck ... you will find the solution in one of the video lectures below.\n",

At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on \\'\\'The Frost Report\\'\\' and \\'\\'At Last the 1948 Show\\'\\'. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman\\'s supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on \\'\\'How to Irritate People\\'\\' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese\\'s desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"Autobiography\">\\'\\'The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons\\'\\'.

But Also]]\\'\\'. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the \\'\\'Flying Circus\\'\\' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I\\'ve ever been in\"—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We\\'ve Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We\\'ve Ever Done\"].

Featuring Cleese as a [[bowler hat|bowler-hatted]] [[civil servant]] in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through [[Grant (money)|grants]], it appears in season 2, episode 1 of \\'\\'Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus\\'\\'.]]\\nAfter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for \\'\\'Do Not Adjust Your Set\\'\\' called \"Beware of the Elephants\", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam\\'s efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the \\'\\'Flying Circus\\'\\' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \"Gilliam\\'s unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\"<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite web|title=Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |access-date=24 August 2019 |website=BBC}}</ref>\\n\\nWriting started at 9:00{{nbs}}a.m. and finished at 5:00{{nbs}}p.m. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\\n\\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|\"[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\" sketch performed by Gilliam, Palin and Jones at the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of animations, Gilliam did considerably less acting, but did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team\\'s humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates\\' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman\\'s many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle\\'s characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\").

On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind.

On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents#BBC Television Service/BBC One|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |access-date=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group\\'s unity and creative independence.

Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. Jones\\' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members—in particular Cleese—with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones\\' importance to Python was often under-rated. He does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian\\'s mother Mandy in \\'\\'Life of Brian\\'\\', \"He\\'s not the Messiah, he\\'s a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|access-date=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film%27s-best-laughter-line.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206011706/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film%27s-best-laughter-line.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 December 2008|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film\\'s best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|access-date=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |access-date=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Michael Palin ===\\nSir [[Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series \\'\\'Ripping Yarns\\'\\' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin\\'s sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After \\'\\'Flying Circus\\'\\', Palin hosted \\'\\'Saturday Night Live\\'\\' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled \\'\\'Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979\\'\\', published in 2007. Palin was awarded a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George|knighthood]] in the [[2019 New Year Honours]], which was announced by [[Buckingham Palace]] in December 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/monty-python-s-michael-palin-gets-knighthood-in-new-year-honours-1-9512598|title=Monty Python\\'s Michael Palin gets knighthood in New Year Honours|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=29 December 2018|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\\n\\n===Associate Pythons===\\nSeveral people have been accorded unofficial \"associate Python\" status over the years.

By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes\\' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album \\'\\'The Rutles: Archaeology\\'\\' and Idle\\'s straight-to-DVD \\'\\'The Rutles 2: Can\\'t Buy Me Lunch\\'\\', each undertaken without the other\\'s participation.

In Cleese\\'s absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\". In the sketch—a satire on mind-boggling bureaucracy—a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor\\'s office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus, Series 4, Episode 6 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031d26j |access-date=29 August 2019 |website=BBC}}</ref> He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon\\'s mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\").

(But you can also use pickle files or start a database if you like that better.)\n",
    ">   - Hint 2: If you now have a directory with all those files, you can use [`os.listdir()`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-os-listdir-method/) to list all the files in that directory within Python and iterate over the files if you need to.\n",

    ">   - You don't have to be perfect. There will be tricky edge-cases, you don't have to solve all of those. The key is to get a pretty good network to work with, not to make everything perfect.\n",
    "> * For each link you extract, check if the target is a person from your list of performers. If yes, keep it. If no, discard it.\n",
    "> * Use a NetworkX [`DiGraph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html) to store the network.\n",
    "> * Store the `length of the content` as an attribute of the node (i.e. count the number of *words* you have in each character's page). By storing this information as a nodal features, we keep all the relevant data in one place. The safe way to count words without counting symbols is to use `regex`, but simpler methods are OK.\n",
    "> * When have you finished, you'll notice that some nodes do not have any out- and in- degrees. Unless you've made a mistake, those are truly isolated bands/singers. Double check for mistakes, then *discard* those disconnected nodes from the network.\n",
    "> * Finally, extract the largest component - it will make our work with visualisations much easier (note: removing *isolated* nodes (with no links) does not guarantee that you are left with the largest component).\n",
    ">     - *Note 1*: For directed graphs use `weakly connected component` to extract the largest component. You can also check the hints on how to extract the largest component of a graph from Week 1 notebook.\n",

    "If you want to make things more fancy, note that Wikipedia writes that local minima is a problem for these graphs: \"It is easy to see that force-directed algorithms produce a graph with minimal energy, in particular one whose total energy is only a local minimum. The local minimum found can be, in many cases, considerably worse than a global minimum, which translates into a low-quality drawing. For many algorithms, especially the ones that allow only down-hill moves of the vertices, the final result can be strongly influenced by the initial layout, that in most cases is randomly generated. The problem of poor local minima becomes more important as the number of vertices of the graph increases. **A combined application of different algorithms is helpful to solve this problem**. For example, using the Kamada–Kawai algorithm to quickly generate a reasonable initial layout and then the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm to improve the placement of neighbouring nodes.\" (my emphasis) "
